    "# üßÆ Database Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is adapted from a paper on database reconstruction attacks. You can find the paper [here](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3295691)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons businesses and governments want to share information about people. It is important that when sharing information, you consider privacy and anonymity of the people that data is derived from. In most cases, aggregate data does little to hinder hackers from being able to re-create a database that is either very close, or exactlythe same as the original data. In this application, we will take a simple example and re-create the database from nothing but aggregate statistics about those people.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will mainly use [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) for this. Imagine we have the following database that contains information for people within a certain geographic area (going forward we refer to this area as a **block**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have *7* people in total in this block. Alongside **age**, we also have each resident's **smoking status**, **employment status** and whether they are **married** or not, we publish a variety of statistics. You have probably seen something similar in your countries census.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üìì To simplify the example, this fictional world has:\n",
    "> - Two marriage statuses; Married (**True**) or Single (**False**)\n",
    "> - Two smoking statuses; Non-Smoker (**False**) or Smoker (**True**)\n",
    "> - Two employment statuses;  Unemployed (**False**) or Employed (**True**)\n",
    "\n",
    "> üëæ One additional piece of logic we know is that any statistics with a **count of less than 3** is suppressed. Suppression of statistics with low counts is often used as a tactic for protecting privacy. The less people there are to represent a statistic, the more they often stick out in a dataset meaning their privacy is often more at risk than those who 'blend in with the crowd'. As we'll see, simply knowing that a statistic is suppressed can even be used to attack a dataset"

    "## 3. Create the variables üíé\n",
    "Now that we have a solver and we have our stats object setup, we can start creating our variables. What we're trying to re-create here is the answers to the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is your age?\n",
    "2. Are you a smoker?\n",
    "3. Are you married?\n",
    "4. Are you employed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step through the approach how we're going to model these are Z3 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is your age? This is pretty straight forward. For this we need an Array of integers for our population size (7) that represents the ages. What we want at the end of this is a list of 7 combinations of ages that exist in order to create the published statistical tables above.\n",
    "2. Are you a smoker? This one is a bit harder. It's possible to model boolean values in Z3 (with `z3.Bool`). However, what is tricky is choosing a subset of our 7 people to model for each cohort. For instance, we have 3 people who are smokers. How do we know which of our 7 ages are associated to those who are smokers?. There are a few ways to do this, but the approach we will follow is this:\n",
    "    - Create a function that can create two `z3.IntVectors`. \n",
    "        - The first one will be of the length pertaining to our cohort (E.g Smokers=3).\n",
    "        - The second one will be the remaining people in that cohort (E.g Non-Smokers=4). It's important that the length of both of these IntVectors == 7\n",
    "    - The IntVectors must contain distinct integers from (0-6) that represent which index in our ages array pertain to that cohort\n",
    "    - From here, we can determine which index of our ages aray are part of a cohort by checking if that index exists in our IntVector\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, for example if we have the following ages array:\n",
    "        - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \n",
    "    \n",
    "    And we've added constraints that tell us smokers exist at positions: [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "    And non-smokers occupy the remaining positions [3, 4, 5, 6]. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can iterate through the ages array and check that that position is in our smokers array to determine if the person at that index is a smoker\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    for i in range(len(ages):\n",
    "        if i in smokers_positions:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Are you married? Same as above\n",
    "4. Are you employed? Same as above"
